Filestash (formerly nuage) is a web client for your org-mode documents. It started as its author believe emacs and org-mode are the greatest thing since sliced bread. The project aims to fix the pain points org-mode's users may have:
- emacs isn't great out of the desktop world
- not everyone is willing to go through learning emacs which makes org-mode a hard to sell tool to manage team project. 

As an org mode client, Filestash can do a lot of cool stuff. For example, this document you are reading is a simple org files that is hosted on a private github repo. It was then rendered to html on the fly by emacs but could also been rendered in a pdf, txt, latex, markdown, open office, beamer, ical.

More than creating wikis, filestash can also be use to manage:

- [[./tasks-projects.org][Tasks & Projects]]
