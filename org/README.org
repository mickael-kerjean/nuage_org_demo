Filestash (formerly nuage) is a web client for your org-mode documents. It started as its author believe emacs and org-mode are the greatest thing since sliced bread. Filestash is aiming to fix the pain points org-mode's users may have:
- emacs isn't great out of the desktop world
- not everyone is willing to go through learning emacs which makes org-mode a hard to sell tool to manage team project. 

In the same way as org mode, filestash can be used for:
- [[./notes-docs.org][Notes & Docs]]
- [[./tasks-projects.org][Tasks & Projects]]

/Notes:/ This document you are reading is hosted [[https://github.com/mickael-kerjean/nuage_org_demo][on github]] and was rendered by emacs using org-mode. As such it is available on a variety of format: html, pdf, txt, latex, markdown, open office, beamer, ical
