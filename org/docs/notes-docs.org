#+TITLE: Notes & Docs

The reader is advised to read this document via the filestash org-mode client accessible [[http://demo.filestash.app/s/wiki?next=/view/docs/notes-docs.org][here]] to interact with the content and get a better idea of what org-mode has to offer

* Creating content

Org mode is a great tool for making documentation. Behind its simplistic model of everything is text, it allows for a lot of features that make your experience better:

- [X] headline toggle by pressing the tab key of your keyboard
- [X] create links to navigate between different pages. For example: [[./emacs.org][go back to the homepage]]
- [X] publish your documentation to form entire wikis available in many different format ([[http://demo.filestash.app/api/export/wiki/text/html/org/emacs.org][html]], [[http://demo.filestash.app/api/export/wiki/application/pdf/org/emacs.org][pdf]], [[http://demo.filestash.app/api/export/wiki/text/latex/org/emacs.org][latex]], [[http://demo.filestash.app/api/export/wiki/text/plain/org/emacs.org][html]], ...). Filestash extends this principle by letting you create different ACL (uploader, viewer or editor) and provide different restriction: password protected, expiration date or restrict to different users
- [X] insert some images in your page [[../assets/background.png]]. Click on the image tag will open the preview inside the org document
- [X] create some private note in your document that won't get exported
#+BEGIN_COMMENT
that mean that this here won't appear in the exported version of your document
#+END_COMMENT
- [ ] a full fledge development environment like the Jupiter notebook in Python but with any language you need

:WTF:      wazaaaahhhhhhhhhhh

If you read this section, make sure you do so from the [[https://demo.filestash.app/api/export/wiki/text/org/org/notes-docs.org][original org-mode]] version as the rendered form will be weird to read. This above is called a [[https://orgmode.org/manual/Drawers.html][drawer]]

Filestash also support org-mode comments:
#+BEGIN_COMMENT
Waaaaazaaaah
#+END_COMMENT

/Note:/ some shortcuts in chrome can't be overwritten by non apps: eg cut will close the current tab. The workaround is to make nuage an app: on chrome go to menu -> more tools -> add to desktop

* What now?

Go back to the [[../emacs.org][homepage and explore]]
