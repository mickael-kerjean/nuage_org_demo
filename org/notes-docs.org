#+TITLE: Notes & Docs

* Creating content

Org mode is a great tool for making documentation. Behind its simplistic model of everything is text, it allows for a lot of features that make your experience better:

- [X] headline toggle by pressing the tab key of your keyboard
- [X] create links to navigate between different pages. For example: [[./README.org][go back to the homepage]]
- [X] publish your documentation to form entire wikis available in many different format (html, pdf, latex, txt, odt, ...). Filestash extend this principle by letting you create different ACL (uploader, viewer or editor) and provide different restriction: password protected, expiration date or restrict to different users
- [X] insert some images in your page [[./test/background.png]]
- [X] create some private note in your document that won't get exported
#+BEGIN_COMMENT
that mean that this here won't appear in the exported version of your document
#+END_COMMENT
- [ ] a full fledge development environment like the Jupiter notebook in Python but with any language you need

If you read this page, make sure you see the [[https://demo.filestash.app/api/export/wiki/text/org/org/notes-docs.org][org-mode]] version of it as the rendered will be hard to understand. This above is called a [[https://orgmode.org/manual/Drawers.html][drawer]]

Filestash also support org-mode comments:
#+BEGIN_COMMENT
Waaaaazaaaah
#+END_COMMENT

/Note:/ some shortcut in chrome can't be overwritten by non apps: eg cut will close the current tab. The workaround is to make nuage an app: on chrome go to menu -> more tools -> add to desktop

* What now?
