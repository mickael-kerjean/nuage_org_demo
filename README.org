* Introduction
This is nuage, a tentative to emulate the org mode goodness on the web making it the perfect companion for all those devices that lacks in openness and keyboards.
/Note:/ Feel free to make changes and experiment, this document is reset every minutes anyway =;)=

* The menubar          :menubar:
** DONE [#A] Folding Toggle
That's the equivalent of the =Shift-Tab= in emacs aka ~org-shifttab~: quite usefull on a mobile devices!
If you're wondering how you can toggle one headline on a mobile device, simply click on the "*" char from the text or the line number =:)=

** DONE [#A] Todos
As you'd expect, the todo view gives you all the =TODO= stuff in your currently open org document. A few things about it:
- tags inheritance is working
- you can create subtasks by using the the checkbox thinghy like: 
  - [ ] I'm a subtask
  - [ ] I'm another subtask
- you can navigate to the corresponding headline 
- you can CRUD the schedule and deadline property straight from there
- You can toggle between TODO and DONE state by just clicking the headline
- For tasks still to be done, priorities are shown with different colors and push to the top so that you can see them

Oh and the search is awesome too, give it a try! The only thing you got to know is if you try to search for a tag, you got to append it a hastag: =#mytag=

** DONE [#A] Agenda
*** Just a dumb agenda entry
Agenda works the same as the todo list except they are not necesseraly a task and are time based.
It support multiple recurrence as well:
<2018-05-05 Sat +1w>

*** DONE A completed task with a scheduled date
SCHEDULED: <2018-01-01 Mon>
Task with a done status won't be shown in your agenda

** TODO [#C] Download
As for now the download button is "dumb" but we're planning on connecting it to an api running the real emacs in the backend to exports in all the format we all know and love =:)=

Wanna help? Come over and [[https://github.com/mickael-kerjean/nuage][contribute]]

- [ ] Create api endpoint
- [ ] Find a proper way to integrate it (download button as a dropdown?)
- [ ] Link it to the app

* General Emacs    :emacs:
** TODO [#B] Emacs general shortcut
SCHEDULED: <2018-05-09 Wed>
A decent amount of shortcut from emacs are already implement. What we did here is also getting some way to make things works great on mobile.

/Note:/ some shortcut in chrome can't be overwritten by non apps: eg cut will close the current tab. The workaround is to make nuage an app: on chrome go to menu -> more tools -> add to desktop

** TODO [#B] Org mode specific
:PROPERTIES:
:WTF: wazaaaahhhhhhhhhhh
